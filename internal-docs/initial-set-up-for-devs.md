# Quarters Unity SDK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install `Unity Hub` and `Unity Editor` (version 2021.3.2f1). The version of Unity Editor is very important to be exactly that one.
2. Also install `Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 - Community`. The installer of the Unity Editor will ask you for installing this also. When the `Visual Studio Installer` runs ensure to tick the following extentions that we will need:
   - ASP.NET and web development
   - Node.js develpment
   - .NET Multi-platform APP UI development
   - Game develpment with Unity
3. Open `Visual Studio` once it's been installed and go to **_Tools -> Android -> Android SDK Manager_**
