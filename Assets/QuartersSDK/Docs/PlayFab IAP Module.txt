Buying Quarters through PlayFab In App Purchases Module


1. Authorize user with quarters
2. Call Quarters.Instance.GetUserDetails
3. Login Playfab user with Playfab.

    Example:

    //login user to playfab title using device id
    LoginWithCustomIDRequest loginRequest = new LoginWithCustomIDRequest();
    loginRequest.CustomId = SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier;
    loginRequest.CreateAccount = true;


    PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(loginRequest, delegate(LoginResult result) {

        Debug.Log("Playfab user logged in: " + result.PlayFabId);

    }, delegate (PlayFabError error){
        Debug.LogError(error.ErrorMessage);
    });


3. Call QuartersIAP.Initialize - All products data will be pulled from store server

    Example:

    QuartersIAP.Instance.Initialize(testProducts, delegate(Product[] products) {
            
    //products lodaded

    }, delegate(InitializationFailureReason reason) {
        Debug.LogError(reason.ToString());
    });



4. You can now call QuartersIAP.Instance.BuyProduct - Native popup will be presented to the user to confirm the purchase. After sucessful payment Playfab IAP module will validate transaction and
   automatically transfer quarters to user account.

    Example:

    QuartersIAP.Instance.BuyProduct(QuartersIAP.Instance.products[0], (Product product, string txId) => {
            
        Debug.Log("Purchase complete");

    },(string error) => {
        Debug.LogError("Purchase error: " + error);

    });
