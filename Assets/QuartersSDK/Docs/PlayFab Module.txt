Quarters Unity SDK - PlayFab Module

PlayFab Module allows transfering quarters from the Quarters app to the users through PlayFab cloud script.
This allows custom logic to be injected to the PlayFab server to verify if transfer request can be authorized.


###############################

Prerequisites:
- PlayFab SDK must me installed prior to module instalation
  https://api.playfab.com/sdks/unity

- Playfab Title


###############################


Installation:
1.  Import content of QuartersSDK/Modules/PlayFab/PlayFabModule.unitypackage to your project
2.  Add QUARTERS_MODULE_PLAYFAB scripting define in Player Settings. If you are supporting more
    than one platform add QUARTERS_MODULE_PLAYFAB scripting define to each platform tab in Player Settings
3.  Open QuartersSDK/Modules/PlayFab/QuartersPlayFabModuleServer.txt,
    copy SERVER_TOKEN for your Quarters App 
    copy APP_ADDRESS for your Quarters App (found in Quarters app settings/Edit app)

    Example:
    var SERVER_TOKEN = "xk9q9fdxhbu65lyplqhwqe29klduvtoj9izi0g4wgrdy56b1dd32";
    var APP_ADDRESS = "0x1e2aa0184dcde9502568593d6c5da68966a32712";

4.  Add whatever custom logic you require using JavaScript in QuartersPlayFabModuleServer.txt in the marked section.


     /*
       ######## ENTER YOUR CUSTOM LOGIC HERE,
       BY DEFAULT EVERY AWARD REQUEST IS ACCEPTED

    */

    This step is critical, custom logic MUST be used. Otherwise any client side request will transfer Quarters out from the Quarters app.


5.  Copy content of QuartersPlayFabModuleServer.txt to your existing Playfab Cloud Script. If you dont have any existing Cloud Script code you can simply
    upload QuartersPlayFabModuleServer.txt stright to Automation section in PlayFab console.




AwardQuarters
---
Award quarters server call allows transfering quarters from Quarters app to user. It can be called from client side through the cloud script handler as well as directly from another Cloud Script function when
Quarters should be awarded to the user.



Example 1:

In this example user requests 2 quarters to be awarded to him. Typical "real life" example would be daily reward for login in to the game.
Call is made from the client side to cloud script server. During the AwardQuarters call cloud script checks when last time reward was given to the user.
Authorization is for this transaction is granted or declined by Cloud Script.






*** client side ***

using QuartersSDK;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;


//login user to playfab title using device id
LoginWithCustomIDRequest loginRequest = new LoginWithCustomIDRequest();
loginRequest.CustomId = SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier;
loginRequest.CreateAccount = true;


PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID(loginRequest, delegate(LoginResult result) {

    Debug.Log("Playfab user logged in: " + result.PlayFabId);

    //Request 2 quarters from Playfab Cloud build
    Quarters.Instance.AwardQuarters(2, delegate(string transactionHash) {

        Debug.Log("Quarters awarded: " + transactionHash);


    }, delegate (string error) {

        Debug.LogError(error);

    });

}, delegate (PlayFabError error){
    Debug.LogError(error.ErrorMessage);
});
