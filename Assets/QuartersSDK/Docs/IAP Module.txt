Installation:
1.  Import content of QuartersSDK/Modules/IAPModule.unitypackage to your project

    than one platform add QUARTERS_MODULE_IAP scripting define to each platform tab in Player Settings
3.  Add Unity IAP package to your project 
4.  iOS - Setup IAP Products on iTunesConnect/<YourApp>/Features
    Requirements for Quarters IAP products (critical, make sure this is configured correctly)
    Example:
        Reference Name: 4 Quarters
        Type: Consumable
        Product ID: 4quarters

    Note: All quarters IAP product IDs MUST follow this naming convention:

        <numberOfQuarters>Quarters

        examples:
            4quarters   
            8quarters
            ..
    
    To test IAP Purchases with iOS you dont have to submit Products to review. If "Paid Applications" agreements is valid and product is in "Ready to Submit" status testing purchases
    with Apples sandbox server will work. For more information how to test Apple IAP follow this link: https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/


5a  Android - Upload build to beta on Google Play console. This step is needed to enable InAppBilling in your console.
6b. Android - Setup IAP Products on Google Play Store
    Requirements for Quarters IAP products (critical, make sure this is configured correctly)
    Example:
        Reference Name: 4 quarters
        Type: Consumable
        Product ID: 4quarters

    Note: All quarters IAP product IDs MUST follow this naming convention:

        <numberOfQuarters>Quarters

        examples:
            4quarters   
            8quarters
            ..
    
    To test Android purchases you must have Google Merchant account setup correctly. Your build number must be identical to the build number specified in Android Manifest. Otherwise Google Store will not
    return any products. More info on testing purchases with Google Play can be found here: https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing

Buying Quarters through In App Purchases Module


1. Authorize user with quarters
2. Call Quarters.Instance.GetUserDetails
3. Call QuartersIAP.Initialize - All products data will be pulled from store server

    Example:

    QuartersIAP.Instance.Initialize(testProducts, delegate(Product[] products) {
            
    //products lodaded

    }, delegate(InitializationFailureReason reason) {
        Debug.LogError(reason.ToString());
    });



4. After successful Initialization you can call QuartersIAP.Instance.BuyProduct - Native popup will be presented to the user to confirm the purchase.

    Example:

    QuartersIAP.Instance.BuyProduct(QuartersIAP.Instance.products[0], (Product product, string txId) => {
            
        Debug.Log("Purchase complete");

    },(string error) => {
        Debug.LogError("Purchase error: " + error);

    });
