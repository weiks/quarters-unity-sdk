#################################


Authorization
----
Before you can use Quarters API you must authorize users session. From version 0.20.0 Quarters Unity SDK support guest mode. This allows to authorize user as guest and give full access
to Quarters features. Guest users can be converted to email users through Quarters.SignUp method. This workflow is required by Apple to conform to their user guidelines.


Example:

using QuartersSDK;

Quarters.Instance.AuthorizeGuest(OnAuthorizationSuccess, OnAuthorizationFailed);

 public void OnAuthorizationSuccess() {
	Debug.Log("OnAuthorizationSuccess"); }   public void OnAuthorizationFailed(string error) { 	Debug.LogError("OnAuthorizationFailed: " + error);  }

----
From this point user is able to buy, spend and get rewarded with Quarters. At some point user should be prompted by the app for signing up to create password protected Quarters account.
Only fully signed up users are able to use Quarters account between apps.

Example of converting guest user to signed up account:

Quarters.Instance.SignUp(OnAuthorizationSuccess, OnAuthorizationFailed);

public void OnAuthorizationSuccess() {
    Debug.Log("OnAuthorizationSuccess");
}


public void OnAuthorizationFailed(string error) {
    Debug.LogError("OnAuthorizationFailed: " + error);

}
 



Get User Details
----
Get user details can be only called after successful authorization. Success delegate returns User object with basic user details.


Example:

using QuartersSDK;

Quarters.Instance.GetUserDetails(delegate(User user) { 	Debug.Log("User loaded");  } , delegate (string error) { 	Debug.LogError("Cannot load the user details: " + error);  } );  


Get accounts
----
Get account can be only called after successful authorization. On success delegate will be called with a list of user accounts. (Note: only one user account is currently supported by the API)


Example:
----

using QuartersSDK;

Quarters.Instance.GetAccounts(delegate (List<User.Account> accounts) { 
//success                  }, delegate (string error) { 
//failed  });


Get Account Balance
----
Get account balance can be only called after successful authorization. On success delegate is fired with User.Account.Balance object


Example:

using QuartersSDK;

Quarters.Instance.GetAccountBalance(delegate (User.Account.Balance balance) {  }, delegate (string error) {   });




Get Account Reward
----
Get account reward can be only called after successful authorization. On success delegate is fired with User.Account.Reward object


Example:

using QuartersSDK;


Quarters.Instance.GetAccountReward(delegate (User.Account.Reward balance) {

}, delegate (string error) {

});




Transfer
----
Transfer request can be only called after successful authorization. This call allows to charge user quarters that will be transferred to your Quarters app. Transfer request is done through external browser, similar to Authorize call. On Success transaction hash is returned. Please note it can take up to 3 minutes for your transfer to appear.


Example:

using QuartersSDK;

TransferAPIRequest request = new TransferAPIRequest(int.Parse(tokensInput.text), descriptionInput.text, delegate (string transactionHash) {             
//success  }, delegate (string error) {

//failed              }); 
//start transfer Quarters.Instance.CreateTransfer(request);
