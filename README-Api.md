# SDK calls to API Documentation

Documentation with the calls and examples that you can use from the SDK to perform the integration.

The PoQ SDK uses the [PoQ API, click here to find its documentation](https://github.com/weiks/poq-docs/blob/main/docs/oauth-api.md#post-apiv1transaction)  

## Quarters Initialization
Before making any of the Quarters SDK calls you must call the following:
 ```
 QuartersInit.Instance.Init(OnInitComplete, OnInitError);
 ```

Where:
| Parameter        | Required | Description                                                        |
| -----------------| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------   |
| `OnInitComplete` | yes      |  Runs this function if the Init function was successful            |
| `OnInitError`    | yes      |  Runs this function if there was an error with the Init function   |

For example:
```
private void Start() {
    // Runs the Init function of the Quarters class. Allows further Quarters functionality if completed
    QuartersInit.Instance.Init(OnInitComplete, OnInitError);
}

//Empty function for now. Gets filled in the next step
//Runs after the Init function has successfully finished
private void OnInitComplete() {

}

//Runs if there was an error during the Init process. Returns an error string.
private void OnInitError(string error) {
    Debug.LogError(error);
}
```

## Sign in with Quarters
Once Quarters Init is completed successfully you need to sign in your user calling:
```
QuartersController.Instance.SignInWithQuarters(OnSignInComplete, OnSignInError);
```
Where:

| Parameter          | Required | Description                                                |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OnSignInComplete` | yes      |  What happens when signing in is successful                |
| `OnSignInError`    | yes      |  Checks to see if there was an error in signing in         |

Example:
```
private void OnInitComplete() {
        
        /*Runs the SignInWithQuarters function of the Quarters class.
    Loads the player's web browser. If they are not logged into their PoQ account, the user will be prompted to sign in.
    Once the user is signed in, they will be redirected to the Authorization screen.
	The player must authorize access to their PoQ wallet to allow Quarters transactions.
    */

    QuartersController.Instance.SignInWithQuarters(OnSignInComplete, OnSignInError);
}

//Runs if the sign in function was successful. Players can make Quarters transactions at this point.
private void OnSignInComplete() {

}

//Runs if there was an error during the Sign in process. Returns an error string
private void OnSignInError(string signInError) {
    Debug.Log(signInError);
}
```

## Authorization Screen
When the  `SignInWithQuarters` function is called, the player will be taken to the Quarters web page on their default browser. 
 
After the player has signed into their Quarters account (if they have not already done so) they will be prompted to allow the game access to the player’s PoQ account information.

⚠️ Important notes: ⚠️

The player must click the **Authorize** button to allow Quarters transactions. Any attempt to exchange Quarters, without being authorized first, will result in an error during the transaction process.

### Making Transactions
You can charge user Quarters as well as reward your user with quarters using unified Transaction API call.
**A negative price takes Quarters from the user's account. Positive price value reward user account with Quarters**

```
public void ButtonTapped() {

   long price = -10;

   QuartersController.Instance.Transaction(price, "Example transaction", OnTransferSuccessful, OnTransferFailed );
   //Depending on your implementation maybe you would need to call `Transaction` method with an `StartCoroutine` 
   //ex:  StartCoroutine(QuartersController.Instance.Transaction(price, "Example transaction", OnTransferSuccessful, OnTransferFailed );
   
}

private void OnTransferSuccessful() {
  
}

private void OnTransferFailed(string error) {

}
```

### Buying Quarters
User can also purchase Quarters by using the credit card or other methods.

**Please note that real money transactions are performed outside the application in the browser to adhere to Apple and Google's guidelines.**

```
QuartersController.Instance.BuyQuarters();
```

### Sign Out
To sign out current Quarters users call
```
QuartersController.Instance.Deauthorize();
```

#### Please note that due to limitations of Unity Editor on Windows external browser is used to authorize user. Additional steps must be taken to authorize a player in the Unity Editor


1. After clicking the **Authorize** button in the browser, the web browser will load a white page. 
2. Have the player copy this new URL
3. When the player returns from the web browser to the game, they will see this prompt in the Unity Editor:

![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41578378/172198600-980454b9-e260-4719-8ad8-621809a2ad14.PNG)

4. Have the player either click the **Paste and Authorize** button or have them paste the URL into the text box and have them click **Authorize**

The game will then finish the sign in process.


### Making Transactions
You can charge user Quarters as well as reward your user with quarters using unified Transaction API calling this method:
``` 
QuartersController.Instance.Transaction(long price, string description, OnTransferSuccessful, OnTransferFailed );
```
**A negative price takes Quarters from the user's account. Positive price value reward user account with Quarters**

| Parameter              | Required | Description                                                |

}
private void OnTransferSuccessful() {
  
}
private void OnTransferFailed(string error) {
}
```

### Buying Quarters
User can also purchase Quarters by using the credit card or other methods calling this API method:

## Player Information

### GetUserDetails

private void Example()
{
	//Calls the GetUserDetails function in the Quarters script

        {
	        //Posts the user’s GamerTag in the console log. user.GamerTag can be referenced as a string
            Debug.Log(user.GamerTag);

            //In case GetUserDetails runs into any errors, delegate can be used to to disclose what went wrong
        }, delegate (string error)
        {
            Debug.LogError(error);
        });

}
